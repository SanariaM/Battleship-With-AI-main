# game/rules.py
# Battleship Project
# This file contains the core battle rules:
# shooting, hit/miss logic, sinking ships, and win checks.
# No UI code lives here.

'''
This file contains the core Battleship rules, completely independent of the UI. 
The fire_shot() function determines whether a shot is a hit, miss, sink, or already-fired location, 
and updates both the attacker’s shot board and the defender’s incoming board. 
It also tracks hits using a set so ship destruction can be detected efficiently. 
The ships_remaining() function counts how many ships are still afloat and is used to determine when the game is over.
