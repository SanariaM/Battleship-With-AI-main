# Battleship Project - Board data + placement validation
# Created: 2026-02-06

'''
This file defines a lightweight Board class that represents a 10×10 grid and provides helper methods for ship placement. 
It knows how to check whether a ship can be placed (can_place), how to place it (place), 
and how to compute which cells a ship would occupy based on position, length, and orientation. 
The board itself does not know about players, turns, or hits — it strictly manages grid validity. 
This separation keeps placement logic clean and reusable.
