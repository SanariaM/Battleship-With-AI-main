# models.py
# Battleship Project
# Shared data structures that represent the current game state.
# This file contains NO UI code and NO game rules.

'''
This file defines the central game state using a dataclass called GameState. 
It stores everything needed to describe the current game at any moment: 
ship placement info, both players’ boards, shot tracking, ship coordinate lists, hit tracking, and turn management.
There is no UI code and no rules logic here, by design — this makes the state reusable and easy to reason about. 
The reset_for_new_game() method cleanly reinitializes all fields so a fresh game can start without restarting the app.
